**ee** is a CLI tool that brings structure and validation to environment variable management. Define schemas, organize configurations across environments, and deploy with confidence knowing your variables are validated and consistent.

## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Schema Validation" icon="approve-check">
		Define variable types, patterns, and requirements. Catch configuration errors before they reach production.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Multi-Environment Support" icon="setting">
		Manage development, staging, and production configurations from a single tool.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Variable Inheritance" icon="puzzle">
		Share common configuration across environments while maintaining environment-specific overrides.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Multiple Export Formats" icon="document">
		Export to .env, JSON, YAML, or load directly into your shell environment.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```bash
# Create a schema for your web service
ee schema create web-service

# Create a project with environments
ee project create my-app --schema web-service
ee project env create my-app development
ee project env create my-app production

# Configure your environments
ee project env set my-app development \
  PORT=3000 \
  DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/dev \
  DEBUG=true

# Run your application with the right config
ee apply my-app development -- npm start
```
