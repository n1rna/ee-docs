---

The `ee` CLI tool is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Choose the installation method that works best for your system.

## Quick Install (Recommended)

Install the latest version with a single command:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://ee.n1rna.net/install.sh | sh
```

This script will:
- Detect your operating system and architecture
- Download the appropriate binary
- Install it to `/usr/local/bin` (or `$HOME/.local/bin` if you don't have sudo access)
- Make it executable

## Alternative Installation Methods

### Using Go

If you have Go installed on your system:

```bash
go install github.com/n1rna/ee-cli/cmd/ee@latest
```

### Download Specific Version

You can install a specific version by providing the version number:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://ee.n1rna.net/install.sh | sh -s -- --version v1.0.0
```

### Build from Source

For development or customization:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n1rna/ee-cli.git
cd ee-cli
make install
```

This requires:
- Go 1.23.3 or later
- Make

## Manual Installation

1. Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/n1rna/ee-cli/releases)
2. Download the appropriate binary for your platform:
   - `ee-linux-amd64` for Linux
   - `ee-darwin-amd64` for macOS
   - `ee-windows-amd64.exe` for Windows
3. Make it executable (Linux/macOS): `chmod +x ee`
4. Move it to your PATH:
   - Linux/macOS: `sudo mv ee /usr/local/bin/`
   - Windows: Move to a directory in your PATH

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that `ee` is working correctly:

```bash
ee version
```

You should see output similar to:
```
ee version 1.0.0
```

## Shell Completion (Optional)

`ee` supports shell completion for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell. To enable it:

### Bash
```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc
source <(ee completion bash)
```

### Zsh
```bash
# Add to your ~/.zshrc
source <(ee completion zsh)
```

### Fish
```bash
ee completion fish | source
```

### PowerShell
```powershell
ee completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have `ee` installed, you can proceed to the [Quick Start guide](/getting-started/quick-start) to learn how to use it.

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied

If you get a permission denied error:
- Make sure the binary is executable: `chmod +x ee`
- Try installing to your home directory: `mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && mv ee ~/.local/bin/`
- Add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH if it's not already there

### Command Not Found

If you get "command not found":
- Make sure the installation directory is in your PATH
- Try restarting your terminal or running `source ~/.bashrc` (or equivalent for your shell)
- Verify the binary is in the expected location: `which ee`

### Network Issues

If the installation script fails due to network issues:
- Check your internet connection
- Try using a VPN if you're behind a corporate firewall
- Download manually from the releases page as a fallback
